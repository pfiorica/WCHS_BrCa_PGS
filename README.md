Calculating breast cancer PGS for the Women's Circle of Health Study

This is a repository for calculating PGS for the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS). Here, we calculate 6 different PGS for breast cancer and its various subtypes. The main document that can be followed for notes on how I calculated PGS is `WCHS_PGS_NOTES.Rmd`. This document provides background on the calculation, PGS Weight cleaning, genotype filtering, and PGS calculation. 

The [troubleshooting](https://github.com/pfiorica/WCHS_BrCa_PGS/tree/main/troubleshooting) folder contains a list of SNPS for each PGS and chromosome that did not match to the genotype. Given that this was checked on both the PLINK.bim files and .gds files, the files in this folder are redundant.

For further questions about these PGS and their calculation, please contact me, Peter Fiorica, at peter.fiorica@roswellpark.org.
